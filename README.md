# Predicting-House-Sale-Prices-Using-Linear-Regression
n this project, I will be working with housing data for the city of Ames, Iowa, United States from 2006 to 2010. The dataset was originally compiled by Dean De Cock for the primary purpose of having a high quality dataset for regression. His paper can be found [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10691898.2011.11889627)
